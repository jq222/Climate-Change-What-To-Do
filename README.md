WE HAVE TO TRY.

> The world’s failure to reverse emissions this decade means that instead of having 20 years — 2010 to 2030 — to cut emissions some 25 percent, we now have 12 years to cut CO2 emissions more than 30 percent.


> Here’s one way to frame the urgency: If the world does not make substantial and sustained progress in cutting total global warming emissions by 2030, then the window will be effectively closed for averting the catastrophic warming of 2°C or higher.
